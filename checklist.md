# ✅ Miniconda Environment Installer – Final Checklist

## 🔧 1. Setup & Input Validation  
- [x] Verify `miniconda` executable path is valid and exists  
- [x] Accept YAML file or directory of YAML files as input (`--file`, `--directory`)  
- [x] Validate input files have `.yaml` or `.yml` extensions  
- [x] Validate YAML files only allow expected keys (`name`, `channels`, `dependencies`, `output`)  

## 📄 2. YAML Parsing & Safety  
- [x] Safely parse YAML files using `pyyaml`  
- [x] Reject YAML files with unexpected top-level keys  

## ⚙️ 3. Conda Environment Management  
- [x] Create new environment if not exists (using `conda env create`)  
- [x] Update existing environment if already exists (`conda env update`)  
- [x] Support specifying output directory for environment path (fallback to `conda`’s envs folder if none specified)  

## 🗂️ 4. Batch Processing  
- [x] Support processing multiple YAML files from a directory  
- [x] Apply create/update logic individually for each YAML file  

## 🧪 5. Error Handling & Logging  
- [x] Use `subprocess.run(..., check=True)` wrapped in `try/except`  
- [x] Catch and display meaningful errors (file not found, bad YAML, conda errors)  
- [x] Inform user which environment is being processed and success/failure  
- [ ] Exit process with a non-zero code if any environment creation/update fails  

## 🧼 6. User Experience Improvements  
- [ ] Show progress output for each environment creation/update (e.g. spinner, progress bar)  
- [ ] Clean, consistent CLI messages and logging  
- [ ] Add verbose/debug mode for detailed output  

## 🧩 7. Enhancements to Polish  
- [ ] Support `.env` file or environment variable for setting `MINICONDA_EXE` path automatically  
- [ ] Add terminal colors and formatting using libraries like `rich` or `colorama`  
- [ ] Support uninstall/removal of environments  
- [ ] Add dry-run mode to preview commands without executing  
- [ ] Add support for specifying Python versions, channels, or other conda options via CLI flags  
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient conda errors
